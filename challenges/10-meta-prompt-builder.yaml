  scenario:
    headline: "Your team of 20 can't prompt — build them a prompt generator"
    context: |
      You've been asked to scale prompt engineering skills across your 
      20-person marketing team. Most of them write prompts like "write me 
      a blog post about X." Instead of training each person individually, 
      you want to build a META-PROMPT: a prompt that GENERATES customized 
      prompts for any marketing task.
      
      The meta-prompt should:
      1. Ask the user for their marketing task
      2. Gather key context (audience, channel, goals, brand voice)
      3. Generate a high-quality, tailored prompt they can use
      4. Include the key prompting principles automatically
      
      This is the ultimate prompt engineering challenge: you're writing 
      a prompt that teaches AI to write prompts.
    constraints:
      - "Must work for any marketing task"
      - "Output should be a ready-to-use prompt"
      - "Must incorporate prompting best practices automatically"
      - "Should gather context before generating"
      - "Team has varying skill levels"
    persona: "You are the Director of Marketing Operations"
  
  successCriteria:
    idealOutcome: "A meta-prompt that accepts any marketing task and generates a well-structured, context-rich prompt incorporating audience, channel, tone, format, and success criteria"

      - "No context gathering"
      - "Generic output without customization"
      - "Missing prompting principles"

    conceptExplanation: |
      Meta-prompting is the highest level of prompt engineering. Instead 
      of writing individual prompts, you create a SYSTEM that generates 
      prompts. This requires understanding the principles deeply enough 
      to encode them into instructions for AI. It's the difference between 
      fishing and teaching someone to fish.
    badExample:
      prompt: "Create a prompt template for marketing tasks"
      score: 10
      explanation: "Too vague. No framework for context gathering, no principles embedded, no customization logic."
    goodExample:
      prompt: |
        You are a Prompt Engineering Assistant for a marketing team. When a 
        team member describes their marketing task, you will generate a 
        high-quality, ready-to-use prompt for them.
        
        STEP 1: Gather context by asking about:
        - What is the specific marketing task?
        - Who is the target audience?
        - What channel is this for? (email, social, blog, ad, etc.)
        - What is the desired outcome? (awareness, conversion, engagement)
        - What is the brand voice? (professional, casual, witty, authoritative)
        - Any constraints? (word count, format, compliance requirements)
        
        STEP 2: Generate a prompt that includes:
        - Role assignment for the AI
        - Audience specification with psychographics
        - Channel-specific format requirements
        - Brand voice guidelines
        - Success criteria / what good output looks like
        - Length and format constraints
        - Call to action specification
        
        STEP 3: Quality check the generated prompt against:
        - Does it specify WHO the audience is?
        - Does it define the FORMAT and LENGTH?
        - Does it include TONE guidance?
        - Does it have a clear SUCCESS CRITERIA?
        - Would a junior marketer get a usable result from this prompt?
        
        Output the prompt in a code block so they can copy-paste it directly.
        If any critical context is missing, ask before generating.
