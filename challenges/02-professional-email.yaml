  scenario:
    headline: "A vendor missed their deadline — again"
    context: |
      Your key software vendor has missed their delivery deadline for the third 
      time this quarter. The delayed feature is blocking your team's product launch. 
      Your VP is asking for updates daily. You need to write a firm but professional 
      email to the vendor's account manager that:
      - Acknowledges the relationship
      - States the impact clearly
      - Requests a concrete remediation plan
      - Sets a final deadline
      You'll use AI to draft this email.
    constraints:
      - "Must maintain the vendor relationship"
      - "VP is watching — needs to be professional"
      - "Third missed deadline (pattern, not one-off)"
      - "Product launch is blocked"
    persona: "You are a Product Manager at a mid-size SaaS company"
  
  successCriteria:
    idealOutcome: "A professional, firm email that balances relationship preservation with clear accountability and concrete next steps"

      - "Tone guidance (firm but professional)"
      - "Key points to cover (impact, history, request)"
      - "Output structure (email format)"
      - "Relationship context"
    mustAvoid:
      - "Asking for a 'generic email'"
      - "No tone specification"
      - "Missing the escalation context"
      - "No mention of desired outcome"

    conceptExplanation: |
      When asking AI to write communications, TONE is everything. 
      "Write an email to my vendor" gives AI zero guidance on whether 
      you want friendly, formal, aggressive, or diplomatic. 
      Always specify: tone, key points, and the desired outcome.
    badExample:
      prompt: "Write an email to my vendor about a missed deadline"
      score: 20
      explanation: "No tone, no context about the relationship or stakes, no structure. AI will produce something generic and likely too soft or too harsh."
    goodExample:
      prompt: |
        Write a professional but firm email to our software vendor's account manager. 
        Context: They've missed their delivery deadline for the 3rd time this quarter, 
        blocking our product launch. 
        
        The email should:
        1. Acknowledge our partnership
        2. State the pattern of missed deadlines
        3. Explain the business impact (blocked launch)
        4. Request a written remediation plan by Friday
        5. Note that we'll need to discuss the contract if this continues
        
        Tone: Direct and professional. Not angry, but clearly serious.
        Length: 200-250 words.
      score: 90
      explanation: "Clear tone, specific context, structured requirements, and a concrete ask. AI knows exactly what to produce."
    expertExample:
      prompt: |
        Role: You are a Product Manager writing to a vendor account manager.
        
        Draft an email with subject line. Context:
        - Vendor: CloudSync Solutions (our data integration partner for 2 years)
        - Issue: 3rd missed delivery deadline this quarter
        - Impact: Our Q1 product launch is now blocked, costing ~$50K/week in delay
        - Recipient: Sarah Chen, Senior Account Manager
        - Our relationship: Generally positive, but this pattern is concerning
        
        Email structure:
        1. Opening: Brief positive note about partnership (1 sentence)
        2. Issue: State the pattern factually (dates if possible)
        3. Impact: Quantify business impact
        4. Ask: Written remediation plan with milestones by EOD Friday
        5. Escalation: Professional note about contract review if unresolved
        6. Close: Express confidence in resolution
        
        Tone: Executive-level professional. Firm but fair. No passive-aggression.
        Format: Ready to send (with subject line). 200-300 words.
      score: 97
      explanation: "Rich context, specific names/numbers, clear structure with purpose for each section, precise tone guidance, and ready-to-use format."
