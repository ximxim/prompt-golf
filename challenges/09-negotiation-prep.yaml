  scenario:
    headline: "Your biggest contract renewal is tomorrow — and they want a 40% price increase"
    context: |
      Your company's most critical software vendor (cloud infrastructure, 
      $500K/year contract) just sent their renewal proposal with a 40% 
      price increase. You need to negotiate this down to no more than 15%.
      
      You want AI to help you prepare by:
      1. Analyzing your negotiation position (strengths and weaknesses)
      2. Generating counter-arguments for each likely vendor justification
      3. Creating a negotiation script with key talking points
      4. Preparing BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)
      5. Suggesting creative win-win proposals
      
      This is the most complex prompting challenge: you need AI to 
      THINK FROM MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES simultaneously.
    constraints:
      - "$500K/year current contract"
      - "40% proposed increase, 15% max acceptable"
      - "3-year relationship with the vendor"
      - "Switching costs are high but not impossible"
      - "Negotiation meeting is tomorrow"
    persona: "You are the VP of Procurement"
  
  successCriteria:

    goodExample:
      prompt: |
        I need to prepare for a vendor contract renewal negotiation tomorrow.
        
        Context:
        - Vendor: Cloud infrastructure provider, 3-year relationship
        - Current contract: $500K/year
        - Their proposal: 40% increase ($700K/year)
        - Our target: No more than 15% increase ($575K)
        - We have moderate switching costs (6-month migration)
        
        Prepare the following:
        
        1. POSITION ANALYSIS
        - Our strengths (as a customer)
        - Our weaknesses
        - Vendor's likely arguments for the increase
        - Our counter-arguments for each
        
        2. NEGOTIATION SCRIPT
        - Opening statement
        - Key talking points (in order of strength)
        - Concession strategy (what we can give)
        - Walk-away line
        
        3. BATNA
        - Top 3 alternative vendors with rough pricing
        - Migration timeline and costs
        - How to credibly reference without threatening
        
        4. WIN-WIN PROPOSALS
        - 3 creative options that reduce price while giving vendor something
        (e.g., longer term, case study rights, volume commits)
        
        Format: Structured brief I can review in 30 minutes.
      score: 91
      explanation: "Rich context, multi-perspective analysis, structured preparation sections, creative win-win thinking, and practical format."
