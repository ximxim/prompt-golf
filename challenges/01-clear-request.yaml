  scenario:
    headline: "Your CEO needs a summary in 2 minutes"
    context: |
      You have a 10-page quarterly sales report sitting in your inbox. 
      Your CEO just pinged you: "I'm walking into a board meeting in 2 minutes. 
      What's the TL;DR on Q3?" You need to use AI to generate a quick summary 
      that hits the key points without overwhelming them.
    constraints:
      - "CEO has only 2 minutes"
      - "Board meeting context (high stakes)"
      - "Q3 sales report (financial data)"
    persona: "You are a Sales Operations Manager"
  
  successCriteria:
    idealOutcome: "A concise 3-bullet executive summary with the most critical metrics (revenue vs target, biggest win, main concern)"
    mustInclude:
      - "Audience specification (CEO, board meeting)"
      - "Output format (bullets, length)"
      - "Content focus (what metrics matter)"
    mustAvoid:
      - "Vague requests ('summarize this')"
      - "No length constraint"
      - "No audience context"

      - "Audience awareness"
      - "Output format specification"
      - "Constraint setting"
      - "Prioritization guidance"
    conceptExplanation: |
      The #1 mistake executives make when prompting AI is being too vague. 
      "Summarize this" tells AI nothing about WHO needs the summary, 
      HOW LONG it should be, or WHAT matters most. The result? Generic fluff.
    badExample:
      prompt: "Summarize this report"
      score: 25
      explanation: "No audience, no format, no focus. AI will guess—and guess wrong."
    goodExample:
      prompt: |
        Summarize this Q3 sales report in 3 bullet points for a CEO 
        with 2 minutes before a board meeting. Focus on: 
        1) Revenue vs target
        2) Biggest win this quarter  
        3) Main concern to address
      score: 92
      explanation: "Clear audience (CEO), format (3 bullets), time constraint, and explicit focus areas."
    expertExample:
      prompt: |
        You are a sales analyst preparing an executive briefing.
        
        Summarize this Q3 sales report for our CEO who has exactly 2 minutes 
        before a board meeting. Output format:
        
        **BOTTOM LINE:** [One sentence: are we on track?]
        
        **3 KEY POINTS:**
        1. Revenue: [actual] vs [target] ([+/- %])
        2. Win: [biggest deal or achievement]
        3. Risk: [main concern + mitigation status]
        
        Tone: Confident, data-driven, no fluff. Max 75 words total.
      score: 98
      explanation: "Role assignment, structured output template, tone guidance, word limit. This prompt will produce consistent, board-ready results every time."
