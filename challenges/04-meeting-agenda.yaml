  scenario:
    headline: "Your weekly team sync is wasting everyone's time"
    context: |
      Your 8-person product team has a weekly sync that always runs over 
      the 60-minute slot. People ramble, topics go off-track, and action 
      items get lost. Your Engineering VP just told you: "Fix the meeting 
      or cancel it." You need AI to help you design a structured agenda 
      template that keeps things focused and produces clear outcomes.
    constraints:
      - "60-minute maximum"
      - "8 team members (2 PMs, 4 engineers, 1 designer, 1 QA)"
      - "Must produce action items"
      - "VP wants visible improvement by next week"
    persona: "You are a Senior Product Manager"
  
  successCriteria:
    idealOutcome: "A structured, time-boxed agenda template with clear sections, owners, and expected outputs for each segment"
    mustInclude:
      - "Time constraints per section"
      - "Roles/owners for each segment"
      - "Expected outputs (not just topics)"
      - "Format specification (template structure)"
    mustAvoid:
      - "Asking for a 'meeting agenda' without structure"
      - "No time boxing"
      - "No output/decision expectations per segment"
  
  educational:
    skillsTaught:
      - "Template design via prompting"
      - "Constraint specification"
      - "Role-based structuring"
      - "Output-oriented thinking"
    badExample:
      prompt: "Create a meeting agenda for my weekly team sync"
      score: 20
      explanation: "No team context, no time constraints, no format, no desired outputs. AI will produce a generic agenda."
    goodExample:
      prompt: |
        Create a structured 60-minute weekly team sync agenda for an 
        8-person product team (2 PMs, 4 engineers, 1 designer, 1 QA).
        
        Requirements:
        - Time-box each section with specific minutes
        - Assign an owner/facilitator to each section
        - Each section should have a clear expected output (decision, action item, FYI)
        - Include a 5-minute buffer for overflow
        - End with a clear action items recap
        
        Format as a table: Time | Section | Owner | Expected Output
      score: 87
      explanation: "Team context, time boxing, role assignment, output expectations, and clear format specification."
