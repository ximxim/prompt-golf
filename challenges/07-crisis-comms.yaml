  scenario:
    headline: "Your product just had a data breach — the clock is ticking"
    context: |
      Your SaaS platform experienced a security incident. Customer data 
      (email addresses and company names) was exposed for approximately 
      2 hours before your team identified and patched the vulnerability. 
      No passwords, financial data, or sensitive documents were affected.
      
      Your CEO needs you to draft communications for THREE channels 
      within the next hour:
      1. Customer email notification (required by regulation)
      2. Public blog post / status page update
      3. Internal Slack message for all employees
      
      Each needs a different tone, level of detail, and call to action.
    constraints:
      - "1-hour deadline for drafts"
      - "3 different channels with different audiences"
      - "Must be legally compliant (data breach notification)"
      - "Balance transparency with not causing panic"
      - "No passwords or financial data were exposed"
    persona: "You are the Head of Communications"
  
  successCriteria:
    idealOutcome: "Three distinct, appropriately-toned communications that are transparent, actionable, and legally mindful — each tailored to its channel and audience"
    mustInclude:
      - "Channel-specific tone and format"
      - "What happened and what didn't happen"
      - "What the company is doing about it"
      - "What the audience should do"
      - "Legal/compliance awareness"
    mustAvoid:
      - "One-size-fits-all message"
      - "Minimizing or hiding the incident"
      - "Over-sharing technical details to customers"
      - "Missing action items for recipients"

      - "Multi-channel communication"
      - "Crisis tone calibration"
      - "Information hierarchy"
      - "Audience-appropriate detail levels"
      - "Legal awareness in prompting"
    badExample:
      prompt: "Write a data breach notification email"
      score: 15
      explanation: "Single channel, no tone guidance, no detail about what happened, no other audiences considered."
    goodExample:
      prompt: |
        Our SaaS platform had a 2-hour data exposure incident. Exposed: 
        email addresses and company names. NOT exposed: passwords, financial 
        data, documents. Vulnerability is now patched.
        
        Draft 3 communications:
        
        1. CUSTOMER EMAIL:
        - Tone: Transparent, empathetic, professional
        - Include: what happened, what was/wasn't exposed, what we're doing, what they should do
        - Length: 300 words max
        - Include subject line
        
        2. PUBLIC STATUS PAGE:
        - Tone: Factual, technical, confidence-building
        - Include: timeline, scope, remediation steps, ongoing monitoring
        - Length: 200 words
        
        3. INTERNAL SLACK:
        - Tone: Direct, calm, action-oriented
        - Include: what happened, what to tell customers who ask, who's handling what, FAQ
        - Length: 150 words
        
        For all: Do NOT minimize the incident but do emphasize what was NOT compromised.
      score: 92
      explanation: "Three channels with differentiated tone, content requirements, length constraints, and cross-cutting guidance on transparency."
