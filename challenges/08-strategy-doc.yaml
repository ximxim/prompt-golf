  scenario:
    headline: "The board wants a market entry recommendation by Friday"
    context: |
      Your company (a B2B SaaS analytics platform, $50M ARR) is evaluating 
      entering the healthcare vertical. The board has asked for a strategic 
      recommendation document that covers:
      - Market opportunity sizing
      - Competitive landscape analysis
      - Required product modifications
      - Go-to-market approach
      - Risk assessment
      - Financial projections (18-month horizon)
      
      You need AI to help structure this analysis. The challenge isn't 
      getting AI to write — it's getting AI to THINK STRATEGICALLY 
      about the problem using proper frameworks.
    constraints:
      - "B2B SaaS analytics platform, $50M ARR"
      - "Healthcare vertical entry"
      - "Board-level document quality"
      - "Must use strategic frameworks"
      - "18-month financial horizon"
    persona: "You are the VP of Strategy"
  
  successCriteria:
    idealOutcome: "A prompt that produces a structured strategic analysis using appropriate frameworks, with clear assumptions, data requirements, and actionable recommendations"
    mustInclude:
      - "Strategic framework specification (Porter's, SWOT, TAM/SAM/SOM, etc.)"
      - "Company context and current position"
      - "Structured output with all required sections"
      - "Assumptions to state explicitly"
      - "Decision criteria for the recommendation"
    mustAvoid:
      - "Asking for a 'strategy document' without frameworks"
      - "No company context"
      - "No output structure"
      - "Generic advice without decision criteria"
  
  educational:
    skillsTaught:
      - "Strategic framework prompting"
      - "Complex document structuring"
      - "Assumption specification"
      - "Decision-oriented output design"
      - "Executive-level communication"
    conceptExplanation: |
      When using AI for strategic analysis, the quality of output depends 
      entirely on the frameworks and constraints you provide. AI can apply 
      Porter's Five Forces or SWOT analysis brilliantly — but only if you 
      tell it to. The key is: specify the analytical lens, provide company 
      context, define the output structure, and state assumptions explicitly.
    badExample:
      prompt: "Write a strategy document about entering the healthcare market"
      score: 12
      explanation: "No company context, no frameworks, no structure, no decision criteria. AI will produce generic consulting-speak."
    goodExample:
      prompt: |
        Create a strategic recommendation document for entering the healthcare vertical.
        
        Company context:
        - B2B SaaS analytics platform, $50M ARR, 500 customers
        - Currently serving retail and financial services
        - 150-person company, $20M in available investment capital
        
        Document structure:
        1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (1 page max, include recommendation upfront)
        2. MARKET ANALYSIS using TAM/SAM/SOM framework
        3. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE using Porter's Five Forces
        4. PRODUCT GAP ANALYSIS (what needs to change for healthcare)
        5. GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY (channels, partnerships, timeline)
        6. FINANCIAL MODEL (18-month P&L projection with assumptions)
        7. RISK MATRIX (likelihood vs. impact, with mitigations)
        8. RECOMMENDATION with clear go/no-go criteria
        
        Key assumptions to state explicitly:
        - Market growth rate
        - Customer acquisition cost estimates
        - Time to first healthcare customer
        - HIPAA compliance timeline and cost
        
        Tone: Board-ready. Data-driven. Clear recommendation with supporting logic.
      score: 93
      explanation: "Rich company context, specific frameworks, structured output, explicit assumptions, and decision-oriented design."
