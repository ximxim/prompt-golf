  scenario:
    headline: "Three stakeholders, three different needs, one update"
    context: |
      Your product launch is 3 weeks away. You need to send a project 
      status update, but your three key stakeholders need different things:
      - The CEO wants a 30-second read: are we on track?
      - The VP of Engineering wants technical risk details
      - The Marketing Director wants to know if launch collateral is ready
      
      Instead of writing three separate updates, you want AI to generate 
      a single, well-structured update with sections that serve all three.
    constraints:
      - "One document, three audiences"
      - "Launch is in 3 weeks"
      - "Each section should be scannable"
      - "Total update should be under 500 words"
    persona: "You are a Program Manager"
  
  successCriteria:
    idealOutcome: "A multi-section status update with an executive summary, technical details, and marketing readiness — each clearly labeled and appropriately detailed"
    mustInclude:
      - "Multiple audience identification"
      - "Section structure per audience"
      - "Appropriate depth per section"
      - "Overall format and length constraints"

    badExample:

      score: 18
      explanation: "No audience differentiation, no format, no context about what each person needs."
    goodExample:
      prompt: |
        Write a project status update for our product launch (3 weeks away).
        
        The update should serve three audiences in one document:
        1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (for CEO): 2-3 sentences. On track? Key risk?
        2. TECHNICAL STATUS (for VP Engineering): Current blockers, risk items, timeline impact
        3. MARKETING READINESS (for Marketing Director): Collateral status, launch prep checklist
        
        Format: Use clear section headers. Each section should be independently scannable.
        Total length: Under 500 words.
        Tone: Professional, factual, forward-looking.
      score: 89
      explanation: "Clear audience segmentation, section-specific requirements, format and length constraints, appropriate tone."
