  scenario:
    headline: "Your team spends 5 hours a week on the same manual task"
    context: |
      Every Monday, your operations team receives 50-100 customer support 
      tickets from the previous week. They manually:
      1. Categorize each ticket (billing, technical, feature request, complaint)
      2. Prioritize by severity (P1-P4)
      3. Write a 1-sentence summary for each
      4. Flag any tickets that need executive attention
      5. Generate a weekly report with trends
      
      This takes 5 hours every week. You want to use AI to automate this 
      workflow. Write a prompt that handles the full pipeline.
    constraints:
      - "50-100 tickets per batch"
      - "4 categories, 4 priority levels"
      - "Must flag executive-attention items"
      - "Output must include weekly trend analysis"
      - "Must be consistent and auditable"
    persona: "You are a Customer Success Operations Lead"
  
  successCriteria:
    idealOutcome: "A comprehensive prompt that processes tickets through categorization, prioritization, summarization, flagging, and trend analysis in a single structured pass"

      - "Priority criteria"
      - "Output format specification"

    mustAvoid:
      - "Vague 'process these tickets' requests"
      - "No category definitions"
      - "No priority criteria"
      - "Missing output format"

    conceptExplanation: |
      Automating processes with AI requires precision that goes beyond 
      casual prompting. You need to define categories with examples, 
      set clear decision criteria, specify exact output formats, and 
      handle edge cases. Think of it as writing a brief for a new employee 
      — if they'd have questions, your prompt is incomplete.
    badExample:
      prompt: "Categorize and summarize these support tickets"
      score: 15
      explanation: "No categories defined, no priority system, no output format, no trend analysis. AI will make up its own system."
    goodExample:
      prompt: |
        Process this batch of customer support tickets through the following pipeline:
        
        Step 1 - CATEGORIZE each ticket into exactly one category:
        - Billing: Payment issues, subscription changes, refund requests
        - Technical: Bugs, errors, performance issues, integration problems
        - Feature Request: New functionality asks, enhancement suggestions
        - Complaint: Dissatisfaction, escalation threats, churn risk
        
        Step 2 - PRIORITIZE each ticket:
        - P1 (Critical): Revenue impact >$10K, security issue, or data loss
        - P2 (High): Customer threatening to churn, or blocking issue
        - P3 (Medium): Impacting workflow but has workaround
        - P4 (Low): Nice-to-have, cosmetic, or informational
        
        Step 3 - SUMMARIZE each ticket in one sentence (max 20 words)
        
        Step 4 - FLAG for executive attention if P1 or involves enterprise accounts (>$50K ARR)
        
        Step 5 - TREND ANALYSIS: Identify top 3 patterns across all tickets
        
        Output format: JSON array with fields: id, category, priority, summary, flagged, flag_reason
        Append a "trends" section at the end.
      score: 91
      explanation: "Complete pipeline with defined categories, priority criteria, clear output format, and trend analysis."
