  scenario:
    headline: "Turn raw numbers into a story your team can act on"
    context: |
      You just exported a CSV of last month's sales data. It has 500 rows 
      covering 12 sales reps, 4 regions, and 3 product lines. Your Sales 
      Director asked you to "find anything interesting" before tomorrow's 
      team meeting. You need to use AI to analyze the data and surface 
      the top insights — but the AI needs to know what "interesting" means 
      to YOUR business.
    constraints:
      - "Sales team meeting tomorrow"
      - "500 rows of data across multiple dimensions"
      - "Need actionable insights, not just numbers"
      - "Director wants 'interesting' findings (vague!)"
    persona: "You are a Sales Analyst"
  
  successCriteria:
    idealOutcome: "A prompt that guides AI to find specific, actionable patterns in sales data — not just describe the columns"
    mustInclude:
      - "What 'interesting' means (define analysis goals)"
      - "Output format (ranked insights, not raw analysis)"
      - "Business context (what metrics matter)"
      - "Actionability requirement (so what? now what?)"
    mustAvoid:
      - "'Analyze this data' with no direction"
      - "No definition of what matters"
      - "Asking for descriptions instead of insights"
      - "No output format specification"

    conceptExplanation: |
      AI is great at finding patterns — but terrible at knowing which 
      patterns matter to YOUR business. "Analyze this data" is like 
      telling a new hire to "look at the spreadsheet." You need to 
      tell AI what success looks like, what metrics matter, and how 
      to present findings so they drive action.
    badExample:
      prompt: "Analyze this sales data and tell me what you find"
      score: 15
      explanation: "No analysis direction, no definition of 'interesting,' no output format. AI will describe column headers and basic statistics."
    goodExample:
      prompt: |
        Analyze this monthly sales data (500 rows, 12 reps, 4 regions, 
        3 product lines) and identify the top 5 most actionable insights 
        for our sales team meeting tomorrow.
        
        Focus on:
        - Which reps are significantly over/under performing vs. quota
        - Any regional trends (growth or decline)
        - Product mix shifts compared to previous months
        - Any deals that look at risk
        
        For each insight, provide:
        1. The finding (one sentence)
        2. The data point supporting it
        3. Recommended action
        
        Rank by business impact. Skip obvious observations.
      score: 88
      explanation: "Clear analysis framework, specific focus areas, structured output per insight, and actionability requirement."
    expertExample:
      prompt: |
        Role: Senior Sales Analyst preparing insights for a Sales Director.
        
        Analyze this sales CSV (500 rows) across these dimensions:
        - 12 sales reps (performance vs. individual quotas)
        - 4 regions (Northeast, Southeast, West, Midwest)
        - 3 product lines (Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB)
        
        Analysis priorities (in order):
        1. REVENUE RISK: Any rep or region trending >15% below quota
        2. GROWTH SIGNALS: Reps/regions exceeding quota — what's working?
        3. PRODUCT SHIFTS: Changes in product mix vs. last quarter
        4. DEAL VELOCITY: Average deal cycle changes by segment
        
        Output format:
        
        **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** (3 sentences max)
        
        **TOP 5 INSIGHTS** (ranked by revenue impact)
        For each:
        - Finding: [specific observation with numbers]
        - Evidence: [data points]
        - Risk/Opportunity: [$ impact estimate]
        - Action: [specific recommendation for tomorrow's meeting]
        
        **WATCH LIST** (reps or deals needing immediate attention)
        
        Skip: Basic statistics, column descriptions, obvious trends.
        Tone: Data-driven, direct, suitable for executive audience.
      score: 96
      explanation: "Role context, prioritized analysis framework, specific thresholds, rich output template with business impact quantification, and clear exclusions."
